            Denji (デンジ?) is the titular protagonist of the Chainsaw Man manga and anime series. He is the main protagonist of the Public Safety Saga and the co-protagonist of the Academy Saga.

As a young boy, he inherits his father's debts from the Yakuza. After meeting Pochita, he becomes a Devil Hunter for the Yakuza in an attempt to clear his debt. Once the Yakuza, under the control of a Devil, betrays him, he dies and Pochita becomes his heart. He is then revived and can become the Chainsaw Man (チェンソーマン Chensō Man?) by pulling a cord on his chest. After meeting Makima, he became a Public Safety Devil Hunter as a member of Tokyo Special Division 4.

Following Makima's death by his own hands, he resigned from his position as a Devil Hunter but continues to fight as Chainsaw Man under the public eye, all the while being enrolled in Fourth East High School as a student. He is also the caretaker and adoptive brother of Makima's reincarnation, Nayuta.
